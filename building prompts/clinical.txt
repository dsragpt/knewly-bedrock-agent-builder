I'm trying to test bedrock agents I built.
there are 2 agents, one is clinicaltrials.gov api, url is https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api#extapi
I finished building already. you can set up config/id to connect it. I want you to come up with different types of possible user questions so I can provide the answers or look at the answers checking its capabilities.
